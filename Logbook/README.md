# Leviathan

A ML project structured around:
- üìò OneNote for logs, ideas, and planning
- ‚òÅÔ∏è OneDrive for storage and sync
- üêô GitHub for publishing, code, and collaboration

All elements are version-controlled and documented in this repository.

This is an ambitious project! Using just the results from 38 leagues published at football-data.co.uk I am going to rate every team and output probabilities for forthcoming matches. In a sense predicting football is easy with data, we've all had a go at it. In a more accurate sense, it is academic unless we are doing it more accurately than the betting market. I have called the project Leviathan where I imagine the betting market, dictated by its most successful players, as the great sea monster.

There is another reason why I want to think about the project as a Leviathan. I expect the project to get complicated. It has its starting point, but thereafter it will not flow like a textbook machine learning project with its usual analogy of a pipeline. It will have digressions, diversions and multiple versions of the same thing before coming together in the output. Far better to think of the data engineering as a story I need to write and explain as well as code. Often, in a sophisticated machine learning project, the naming of parts becomes difficult and can render results incomprehensible. To avoid this  I am going to cleave to a naming structure derived for the story and characters from Moby Dick. 

I am going to write the project in OneNote and save to OneDrive and Github. Obviously, there will be code in Git as well, Unity Catalog and Mlflow will help keep track of the project in Azure Databricks but,
