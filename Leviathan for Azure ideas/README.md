# ðŸš€ Leviathan for Azure Ideas

This folder contains planning and prototype work for migrating the Leviathan football modeling project to the Azure ecosystem (Data Lake, Databricks, Delta Lake, etc.).

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- `scripts/` â€“ Notebooks and setup scripts used to define the Azure vision
- `*.md` â€“ Modular markdown documents describing architecture, transformations, and migration plans

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

- Design an end-to-end scalable version of the Ocean + Armory structure
- Replace local CSVs with Delta Lake tables and Databricks jobs
- Preserve the Moby Dick metaphor for model structure and layering

## ðŸ§  How to Use

- Update each `.md` file as your thinking evolves
- Record table designs, folder structures, and open questions
- Use `build_azure_ideas.ipynb` to regenerate documentation scaffold if needed

This folder will become the master plan for replicating Leviathan in a production cloud environment.
