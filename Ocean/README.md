# 🌊 Ocean: The Leviathan Football Data Lake

Each league (e.g., England_1) contains layered data files named after ocean creatures:

- 🦠 Plankton — Basic results
- 🦐 Krill — Adds halftime results
- 🦑 Squid — Adds referee/stats
- 🐢 Turtle — Adds WH/VC/B365 odds
- 🐬 Dolphin — Adds PS consensus odds
- 🐋 Orca — Adds totals, Asian lines, closing odds
- 🐳 SpermWhale — Complete rows only (same as Orca for now)

Use the layer that best matches your modeling needs.
